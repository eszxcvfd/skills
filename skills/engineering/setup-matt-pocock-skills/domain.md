# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should discover and consume project documentation.

## Work Routing

Open only the smallest current document set needed:

- orientation and change routing: `ARCHITECTURE.md`;
- doc ownership and routing: `docs/README.md`;
- lane selection and proof: `docs/process/DEVELOPMENT.md`;
- current work queue: `docs/issues/ROADMAP.md`;
- non-trivial plans or durable coordination: `PLANS.md`;
- runtime or protocol ownership: `docs/architecture/RUNTIME.md` and
  `docs/architecture/NETCODE.md`;
- server-relevant resource and cook/package boundaries:
  `docs/architecture/CONTENT.md`.

Doctrine is editable repo truth. If governing docs are silent or stale, record
the bounded inference or update the canonical owner doc before relying on a
new rule.

`docs/process/DEVELOPMENT.md` owns lane selection, and `PLANS.md` owns the
conditions and contents for design notes and checked-in plans. Do not invent
another routing rule here. Do not trigger closeout for doc-only edits, small
owner-neutral fixes, or partial progress unless the governing plan requires it.

The setup skill initializes this canonical owner set together. It is a routing
map, not a requirement to read every file on every task: open only the smallest
current set relevant to the work. Missing or stale content is evidence about
the repository's maturity; record bounded inference and update the canonical
owner before relying on a durable rule.

## Before exploring

After the Work Routing preflight, read only the domain artifacts relevant to
the task:

- **`CONTEXT.md`** at the repo root, or the relevant files named by
  **`CONTEXT-MAP.md`** when the repo has multiple contexts;
- **`docs/adr/`** and any context-scoped ADR directory for decisions that
  constrain the area you're touching;
- the spec, ticket, or current work item.

Do not require a glossary or ADR directory to exist. The `/domain-modeling`
skill creates those artifacts lazily when terms or consequential decisions
actually get resolved.

## File structure

Single-context repo (most repos):

```
/
├── CONTEXT.md
├── docs/adr/
│   ├── 0001-event-sourced-orders.md
│   └── 0002-postgres-for-write-model.md
└── src/
```

Multi-context repo (presence of `CONTEXT-MAP.md` at the root):

```
/
├── CONTEXT-MAP.md
├── docs/adr/                          ← system-wide decisions
└── src/
    ├── ordering/
    │   ├── CONTEXT.md
    │   └── docs/adr/                  ← context-specific decisions
    └── billing/
        ├── CONTEXT.md
        └── docs/adr/
```

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept (in an issue title, a refactor proposal, a hypothesis, a test name), use the term as defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept you need isn't in the glossary yet, that's a signal — either you're inventing language the project doesn't use (reconsider) or there's a real gap (note it for `/domain-modeling`).

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding:

> _Contradicts ADR-0007 (event-sourced orders) — but worth reopening because…_
